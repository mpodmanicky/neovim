Configuration files for NeoVim.

### Motivation
I wanted to challange myself and maybe become better at coding/programming. The main motivation is that I 
wanted to use something lightweight and still colourful enough for my coding and programming work for school.
I am reluctant and safe to say I have had enough of the vscode sheit. So I followed some examples and learned the essentials needed
to create my own config an for my own needs.

### First steps
At first all I did was follow someone on YouTube who did their configuration, but after time I was bored. Most times
I deleted entire config to start over. Then after few tries I wanted to go solo, so I decided to follow instructions on most of the plugins I use.
Best way to learn right.

First I installed LazyVim plugin as my plugin manager. Simple, lightweight, easy to understand and I like the structure.
