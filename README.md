Configuration files for NeoVim.

### Motivation
I wanted to challange myself and maybe become better at coding/programming. The main motivation is that I 
wanted to use something lightweight and still colourful enough for my coding and programming work for school.
I am reluctant and safe to say I have had enough of the vscode sheit. So I followed some examples and learned the essentials needed
to create my own config for my own needs.

### Computer Configuration
Funny though, I am running Windows 10 on my gaming laptop. I used to dual boot or even only use Linux during the first year in University.
After the first year, I bought 2015 macbook pro. Which was fine, coming from UNIX environment, although for work not powerful enough.
So I had to switch back to my old machine which I upgraded when I went to uni.
**Backstory**: I was an avid gamer in my teenage years, but was not doing enough school I guess. Not much interested in school so I did the least work
necessary to get good grades, which was one condition I had to accomplish, in order to recieve the laptop for my birthday.

I am running on 2018 Asus ROG Strix GL503VD. 
Configured:
- Intel 7700HQ at 2.8GHZ, up to 3.8GHZ
- GTX 1050 4GB
- 16 GB DDR4 2400MHZ ( was 8GB )
- 128GB System SSD ( soon to be upgraded to 1TB M.2 )
- 1000GB HDD ( most of my games are here )

While it was enough back then, the 128GB system drive is not enough today, since I put a lot of my stuff there which I need to fast load.
Nowadays I'm running at 8GB free space on that drive. That's one reason I needed a lightweight text editor which would be powerful enough to 
help me finish my tasks and exams.

### First steps
At first all I did was follow someone on YouTube who did their configuration, but after time I was bored. Most times
I deleted entire config to start over. Then after few tries I wanted to go solo, so I decided to follow instructions on most of the plugins I use.
Best way to learn right.

First I installed LazyVim plugin as my plugin manager. Simple, lightweight, easy to understand and I like the structure.
